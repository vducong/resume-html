# Duc Cong Vu's resume template

Too tired from adjusting font formats and aligning spacing on Google Docs, I created this template for the peace of mind of resume editing.

Built with Create React App (CRA) and TypeScript, this project aims to provide an easy-to-use and customizable template to help you create a professional-looking resume quickly

## Getting started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vducong/resume-html.git
cd resume-html
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Usage

Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

### Customize your resume

1. Edit the data

   Change the `src/masterData.ts` file to include your details, education, work experience, skills, and whatever else makes you look cool :D

2. Edit the structure

   Tweak the `src/App.tsx` file and components in the `src/components` directory if you want to mess with the structure.

3. Edit the styles

   Go wild with the styles in the `src/styles` directory.

### Printing to the PDF

To get a PDF version of your resume, use your browser's print functionality. While previewing the resume in the browser, press `Ctrl + P` (or `Cmd + P` on Mac) and choose "Save as PDF" as the destination.
